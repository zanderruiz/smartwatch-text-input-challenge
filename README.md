# Smartwatch Text Input System Prototype

Welcome to the repository for our smartwatch text input system prototype. This project was part of a week-long challenge in human-computer interaction (HCI) design aimed at enhancing the typing experience on a small one-inch touch screen. Our approach involved leveraging wheel menus and intuitive interactions to optimize the user's typing speed.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project was to improve upon conventional smartwatch text input systems with the user-experience at the center of our design. We focused on creating a solution that not only improves typing speed but also presents a system that's simple and easy for users to learn quickly. Through a rapid period of iterative prototyping, we aimed to address the challenges presented by a small screen and limited interaction options to create the most user-friendly smartwatch typing experience.

## How to Use
Our smartwatch text input system, crafted in [Processing](https://processing.org/)—a powerful Java-based software sketchbook great for rapidly prototyping interactive graphical interfaces—offers a unique wheel menu interface. Here's a quick guide on how to navigate the system:

- Main Menu: Fire up the program, and voila! You're greeted with an initial menu featuring multiple letter groups. Click that center button, and you're off to exploring a specific group.

- Context Wheel Menu: Dive deeper by clicking a menu button, guiding you into a context wheel menu tailored to the selected letter group. Interact with the wheel to pick your desired letter or option.

- Center Button Functions: In the main menu, the center button pulls double duty as your trusty space key. When you're knee-deep in a context wheel menu, it's your ticket back to the main stage.

- Swipe Left: Made a little oopsie? No worries—just swipe left to trigger the backspace function and tidy up those typos.

## Challenge Overview
Our team participated in a competitive challenge against 30 other teams to create a superior smartwatch typing motif. The challenge involved improving a preliminary letter selection screen commonly found in basic smartwatch implementations. Despite the time constraints, we pushed ourselves to achieve the best possible system with multiple ideation and prototyping sessions throughout our week-long sprint.

## Performance Results
On the final day of the challenge, extensive user testing revealed that our prototype achieved a remarkable average typing speed of 6.32 words per minute. While we may not have secured the top spot, our performance demonstrated a 300% improvement over the initial tests of the preliminary system.

## Key Learnings
Our journey provided valuable insights into smartwatch input design and human-computer interaction. We garnered several ideas for future improvement of our system from our user testing, including but not limited to:

- Accessibility: Prioritize commonly selected characters for easy user access.

- Intuitiveness: Design systems that closely resemble real-life interfaces users are familiar with, such as something more closely in line with the QWERTY keyboard.

- Prediction: Incorporate intelligent word prediction mechanisms to enhance typing speed. Consider leveraging natural language models for more accurate predictions, mitigating any latency issues that may arise from such a complex feature to implement.

## Future Considerations
As we reflect on our experience, we recognize the importance of incorporating user feedback and refining our prototype. Future iterations may explore implementing a QWERTY keyboard or other familiar input systems. Additionally, the integration of advanced word prediction, possibly leveraging natural language models, could further enhance the user experience.

## Conclusion
This project not only pushed the boundaries of smartwatch text input but also deepened our understanding of user-centric design and rapid prototyping. We hope this repository serves as a testament to our dedication to innovation in human-computer interaction.
